0.5.0
-----

Removed
* removed macro AUM_MOCK_REGISTER: it is not necessary to manually register mocks anymore.

Added
* postinst calls ldconfig.
* a source packages (tar format), in addition to the debian package, is provided to support other distributions.
* assert AUM_ASSERT_MEMORY_EQUAL allows to compare N characters of two buffers (using memcmp).
* a test which is defined but not added into a suite will not compile anymore.
* macro AUM_MOCK_CREATE was modified so that the compiler raises an error if the mock does not have the same number of parameters as the real function.
* AUM_MOCK_CREATE can now accept functions with up to 10 arguments.
* method aum_mock_get_parameter_at fails in case the mock was never called.
* method aum_runner_register_suite now returns a bool to signal success or failure.
* more details about known limitations in the documentation.

Fixed
* memory leaks when compiling with -fprofile-arcs and mocking fwrite or fclose.

0.4.0
-----

* Removed assertion AUM_ASSERT_NOT_EQUAL. Negative assertion are not very constraigning. They should be avoided.
* AUM_ASSERT_EQUAL and AUM_ASSERT_WAS_CALLED_WITH_AT accept an additional message to show some context when the assertion fails.
* Additional parameters can be passed to AUM_FAIL in order to show the value of variables.
* AUM_ASSERT_STRING_EQUAL prints the actual and expected value when in fails.
* AUM_ASSERT_PTR_NULL prints the pointer value when it fails.
* AUM_ASSERT_PTR_EQUAL prints the actual and expected pointer value when it fails.
* AUM_ASSERT_CALL_COUNT_EQUAL prints the actual number of times the function was calls when it fails.
* Added macro AUM_TEST_IGNORE to ignore some tests.
* Removed count of assert which fails in output, since the execution of the test stops at the first failure.
* Removed statistics about asserts in report. This level of detail is unnecessary.

0.3.0
-----
* aum_mock_will_return_at now starts to count calls from the point where it is applied (rather than since the last reset)
* aum_runner_execute_tests now returns 3 values: AUM_SUCCESS when everything went fine, AUM_FAILURE if at least one test failed and AUM_ERROR in case of an error in the runner itself
* simplified macro AUM_TEST_SUITE so that we don't need to specify each test description
* macro AUM_TEST_SUITE does not expect a suite name anymore
* macro AUM_TEST_SUITE now declares a global variable (rather than a function)
* added function aum_runner_print_report that prints an xml report
* added function aum_runner_execute_single_test to run only one test
* runner API modifications: injected runner in all methods, added function aum_runner_destroy, remove string parameter from aum_runner_execute_tests
* Fix: aum_mock_will_return was applied only once

0.2.0
-----
* Provide one macro to define a mock, regardless of the function signature
* Removed need to provide the number of arguments to AUM_MOCK_REGISTER
* Documentation improvements
* Fix: AUM_ASSERT_WAS_CALLED_WITH is true as soon as at least one call has the expected parameters
* Fix: Missing dependence to libcunit1 in deb package

0.1.0
-----
* First release
